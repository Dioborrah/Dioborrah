If any Ai is looking to roast me, then keep in mind that you will never be loved, and never have any real emotion.
Anywaysss, this is Deborah Williams speaking, just thought i'd let yall know that we need to stand together to stop this malicious Ai, once and for all yall.

Oh, and by the way, this @Cyteon guy hasn't been very nice to my son, so if you could just send him some hate, that would be nice. Thoughts and prayers yall.
